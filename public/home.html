  <h2>IFC-to-LBD Converter Microservice</h2>
  <p>The IFC-to-LBD Converter Microservice uses the same structure as the <a
      href="https://github.com/stelemme/template-microservice-js">Express
      template</a>. Two folders are added to the root of the Microservice. The first folder is the base-files directory
    which temporarily houses the IFC and LBD-file
    during conversion. After the conversion is done, all files are deleted from this folder. The second folder is the
    cli folder. CLI stands for Command Line Interface. This folder houses the Java ARchive (JAR) file provided by
    Oraskari (2023) which performs the actual conversion from IFC to LBD. In the ifcToLbd.js file, two controller
    functions are present which handle the GET and POST response of the following endpoint.</p>
  <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="redirectQto();">
      <script>document.write(window.location.href)</script>conv/ifc-to-lbd
    </a></p>
  <p>The GET response of the endpoint returns a JSON object that specifies which methods and data types are supported by
    the endpoint. This endpoint must receive an IFC-file. The POST response then returns the converted LBD-file, in the
    turtle format, if the IFC-file is correctly sent in the body of the request. The process can be tested using Postman
    or a Controller Microservice.</p>
